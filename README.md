# Ibrahim Malas - Personal Website
This is the source code for my site, [cubidian.me](https://cubidian.me). <br>
Eventually, I will have a blog and my portfolio up there,
but in the meantime, i'm learning front end development.
It currently has a rough structure set out for me to follow through with,
and I am using that structure along with the MDN documentation
so I can produce a good-looking, functional website.
